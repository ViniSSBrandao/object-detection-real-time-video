# Real-Time Object Detection in Video

This project explores real-time object detection for tracking moving objects, leveraging OpenCV for efficient detection. The core of the project involves detecting objects in video frames and visualizing their movement and behaviors.

To better understand the effects of model fine-tuning, check out the videos `decay_heatmap.mkv` or `frame_by_frame_heatmap.mkv`. These videos demonstrate the visual impact of adjustments made during the detection process, showing how different fine-tuning strategies influence the final results in detection, perception and usability.
